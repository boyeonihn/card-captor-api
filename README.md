# Cardcaptor Sakura Cards Comparer
As a fan of the anime and manga, Cardcaptor Sakura, I wanted to build a project that displays both Clow and Sakura cards for a side-by-side comparison.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

I built this simple Cardcaptor Sakura cards comparison website by incorporating <a href ="https://github.com/JessVel/sakura-card-captor-api">an API created by JessVel.</a> 
Using "Clow Card" and "Sakura Card" key-value pairs within the object, I created a website featuring two functions: 
<ol>
  <li>Search for a specific card and see the Clow vs. Sakura cards</li>
  <li>Click on the random card picker button to view any Clow/Sakura card pair.</li>
</ol>

## Optimizations

Once I have more time outside my main projects, I would love to work on making this project stylistically more pleasing. Also, the API often returns with a 404 error, and I would like to create a conditional that edits the DOM to tell the reader to either refresh or click one more time to use the API. 


## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to access the API key-value pairs in order to obtain the img source link to display the two cards. I also learned how to manipulate and render the DOM so that the img elements do not appear until the user either searched for a card or clicked on the random card button. 


## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
